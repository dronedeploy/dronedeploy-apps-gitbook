# Deprecation Note
This repository has been forked to enable correct sync to gitbooks: https://github.com/ddbotgitbooksync/dronedeploy-apps-gitbook

Please make updates to the documentation there.

# DroneDeploy Developer Documentation

This site is hosted at developer.dronedeploy.com, it is intended for developer partners - both app developers and enterprise clients - to understand how to integrate with our platform.

There are three main sections of this website, and this repo is designed to build them into one site
 - Marketing pages - developer overview, case studies etc
 - Documentation - hand written documentation on how to use our javascript and backend APIs
 - API Reference - Automatically generated documentation based on our GraphQL endpoint, generated by graphdoc

## Building
To build everything into one site run `make package`. This will build the gitbook, the graphdoc and put the landing page assets into the `./build` directory. This will be automatically pushed up to S3 during the Jenkins build.

To run the built site run `make run`, note that [`http-server`](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) is required to run the built server.

## Developing
Since there are three different sources combined into one each one has it's own way to easily update.

#### Marketing pages
All marketing pages are stored in the `./landing_page` directory. Using [`http-server`](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) or similar to serve the pages. The links to the other sections will 404 since for that you need to run the whole build process.

#### Documentation (gitbook)
You can develop this by running [gitbook's CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitbook-cli). After installing you can run `gitbook serve` and it will build and serve the gitbook documentation.

#### GraphDoc
This is automatically generated from the graphql schema so to add to this you need to open up a PR against drone_web and modify [the schema file](https://github.com/dronedeploy/drone_web/blob/master/server/graphql_apis/schema.py)

## Publishing to GitBook

Our GitBook account uses the built-in integration with GitHub to automatically sync our content
from GitHub directly to GitBook.

#### Updating GitBook content

We are automatically syncing the `prod` branch from this GitHub repo to GitBook so the process for updating
GitBook is simple:

When you are ready to update the GitBook content, merge the latest `master` branch into `prod` and let GitBook
take care of the rest.
