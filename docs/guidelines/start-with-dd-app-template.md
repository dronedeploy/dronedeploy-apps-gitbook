# Getting Started

## Download DD App Template

We have designed a basic template which includes our stylesheet and collapsible component. Download it [here](/expandable app example here).



## Grid System

Our default styles include a basic 4 column grid system, enabling a layout for your app that is similar to the DroneDeploy site:

Content should generally be left-justified.

There are three major components — containers, rows, and columns.

* Rows are horizontal groups of columns that ensure your columns are lined up properly.

* Containers — `.container` for the appropriate fixed width and maintaining app related elements within scope.

* Column classes indicate the number of columns you’d like to use out of the possible 4 per row. So if you want 2 equal-width columns, you’d use `.col-2`twice or if you’d like an icon, then 3 columns of text, you’d use `.col-1`, and then `.col-3`

* Hierarchy: `.container`  **&gt;** `.row` **&gt;** `.col-4`
