## Payments.charge

#### Overview

This call allows your app to ask the user for a one time payment. Users must have a paid account to run paid apps. Payments will processed at the end of the month. When you request a payment, the user will see a request.

**Parameters**

```javascript
const amount = Number;
const paymentFor = String;
dronedeployApi.Payments.charge(amount, paymentFor);
```

#### Example Call

```javascript
dronedeployApi.Payments.charge(4.00, 'Testing Payments')
  .then(
    function(success){ console.log('paymentId:', success) },
    function(error){ console.log(error) }
  )
```

**Note:** If your app is not published the returned paymentId is fake and is not saved to our database. Additionally, having a paid account is not enforced while in development.

Here is a screenshot of what you would see if your app is not published.  ![](/assets/fakepayment.png)

#### Example Response
