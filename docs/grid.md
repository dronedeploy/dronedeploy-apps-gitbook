# Side Panel Grid

### Grid Structure

Our grid includes a flexbox grid with a 4-column layout. The width of the grid is a fixed value.

**This is how the grid works:**

* Containers allow you to center your content within DroneDeploy's app side panel. It also keeps all your code within scope of the container.
* Rows are placed inside a container. Rows allow you to align content horizontally. 
* Columns are placed inside a row. Columns allow you to set the number of columns that will compose your layout within a row. 

The grid is composed of three major components a container &gt; row &gt; 4 columns.

    <div class="col-1">2</div>
    <div class="col-1">3</div>
