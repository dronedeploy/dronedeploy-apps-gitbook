# Success Condition

All apps must call [Track.succcessCondition\(\)](#success-condition). Before submitting an app for approval you'll have to successfully use your app then click "Submit for Approval" without refreshing, restarting, or switching devices. We ask our developers to do this for a couple reasons:

* To encourage each app developer to think about what "success" means to the user
* So we can help you with the success of your app.  app \(through tracking "successful" app runs\)
* To ensure every published app is _testable_ and has been fully tested and is cross browser compatible.

Apps related to flights can be tested using the simulator. If you need help on how to test your app or it's a unique situation that should be exempted from our policy, reach out to us at [developer@dronedeploy.com](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dronedeploy/dronedeploy-apps/edit#).
