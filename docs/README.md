# DroneDeploy Platform Overview

DroneDeploy allows external developers to build powerful integrations and extensions of the DroneDeploy platform using two main ways:

* APIs - you can use our public APIs to create, read and update data in the DroneDeploy platform
* Apps - you can create front end apps which run in the DroneDeploy interface which can then be installed by users or organizations
